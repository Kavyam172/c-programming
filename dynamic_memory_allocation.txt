Functions for dynamic memory alloctaion:
    1.malloc()                             SYNTAX: ptr = (int*) malloc(size in bytes)
        -memory alloctaion
        -reserves a block of memory in heap for a fixed no. of bytes
        -returns a void pointer, so we typecast it into pointer of some datatype
        - if memory is insufficient, it returns NULL pointer
        -all values of allocated memory have garbage value by default
    

    2.calloc()                             SYNTAX: ptr = (int*) calloc(n,size in bytes)
        - contiguous alloctaion
        -reserves n blocks in heap for a guven no. of bytes
        -retruns void pointer,needs to be typecasted
        -return NULL pointer if alloctaion fails
        -allocated memory has 0 as value by default

    3.realloc()                            SYNTAX: ptr = (int*) realloc(ptr,new size in bytes)
        -reallocation
        -we can reallocate memory of a given pointer where memory is already allocated
        -this is useful when memory is insufficient


    4.free()                                SYNTAX: free(ptr)
        -free the memory
